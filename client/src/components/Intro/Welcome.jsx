      <h1>👋 Welcome to the hacked Hardhat + React Box by XaEk!</h1>
      <p>
        This was everything you need to start using Truffle to write,
        compile, test, and deploy smart contracts, and interact with
        them from a React app. Now, it has been hacked!! 🤯 You should be
        able to use Hardhat to do the same things, and more! 🚀 If you find any bugs,
        or any ways to improve this, fork and PR! 🙏
